[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/juliangruber/streamstache.png)](http://travis-ci.org/juliangruber/streamstache)

## Example

Given this template:

```html
<div>{foo}</div>
<div>{bar}</div>
```

```js
var streamstache = require('streamstache');
var fs = require('fs');

var tmpl = streamstache(fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/multi.html'));
tmpl.pipe(process.stdout);

tmpl.foo = 'bar';

setTimeout(function() {
  tmpl.bar = fs.createReadStream(__dirname + '/lorem.txt');
}, 500);
```

The output is:

```html
<div>bar</div>
<div>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</div>
```

Because **streamstache** is streaming, the output arrives in 2 chunks, as `bar`  is only set after 500ms. The first chunk is:

```html
<div>bar</div>
<div>
```

The second and last chunk then is:

```html
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...</div>
```

## Syntax

### Interpolation

* `{<key>}`: Gets replaced with the `String` or `Stream` set under `key`.

Reserved keys:

* get
* set
* setEncoding
* pipe

### Blocks

Blocks are denoted with `{#<key>}...{/<key>}` but take on different roles
depending on the content in the scope at `key`.

When the value for a block is an array, the content is looped over for each
element in the array with the scope augmented by the array element value.

When the value for a block is a stream, the content is looped over each time a
new row arrives, augmenting the scope with the row value until the stream ends.

When the value for a block is anything else, it is treated as a boolean.
When a boolean is false, the content between `{#key}` and `{/key}` is hidden.
Otherwise, the content is shown.

## API

todo.

### streamstache(tpl[, scope])

### streamstache#{key} = value
### streamstache#set(key, value)

### streamstache#{key}
### streamstache#get(key)

### streamstache#setEncoding(encoding)

### streamstache#pipe(stream)

## TODO

* figure out the syntax and feature set to support
* iteration over streams

## Installation

For node or browserify install with [npm](https://npmjs.org):

```bash
npm install streamstache
```

For browser usage as a standalone library, grab a build from the [dist](https://github.com/juliangruber/streamstache/tree/master/dist) directory.
